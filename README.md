# Hackslash_Blockchain

## Problem Statement:
- To develop a platform which collaborates event organizers and charitable trusts or
NGOs with end users who pay through blockchain tokens for different events on the platform
and a part is contributed to the trusts or NGOs.

## Description:

- Many NGOs struggle to collect or raise funds for their trusts. This platform will register
and collect important data on partner NGOs and will be shown to various event organizers. The
event organizer who selects our platform to sell his product will select such NGOs as partners
who then will be contributed certain amount when a user of the platform buys any
product(tickets or passes) from our platform by blockchain tokens. We have to take crucial steps
to provide transparency with the contributions so that the user knows where is funds are
allocated.
